# Pyber_Challenge
## Objective
Demonstrate how the data behaves when it is analyzed by city type and how this will let the decision makers have some leverage at Pyber.

## Analysis

The first data frame created shows us the data summary for total rides, total drivers , total fares, average Fare per ride and average fare per driver.
As we can see in the data frame the Urban city type has the most total rides and at the same time the Average Fare per ride is the lowest compared to the othe categories.

## Results

When showing the linear plot of how the Total Fare prices behaves during the first four months, we can see that every city type behaves in a similar way. This tell us that even though the prices differ in every category, the demand is almost the same.

## Recommendations
Analyzing this data is very helpful when creating marketing campaigns. We can have a more clear overview of what is going on with the prices and demand depending on each city type and departing from there we can invest in creating a higher demand for cities that are not generating the expected income.
